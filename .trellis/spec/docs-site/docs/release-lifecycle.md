# Docs-Site Release Lifecycle

> How `docs-site/` is structured across `release-only`, `release+beta`, `release+rc` states, and the three scripts that drive transitions.

---

## Convention: root = current stable

The directory layout pins one role per location:

| Path                                    | Role                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| `docs-site/{start,advanced,...}` (root) | **Current stable** (latest GA). Default. |
| `docs-site/beta/{start,advanced,...}`   | Active **beta** cycle (when one exists). |
| `docs-site/rc/{start,advanced,...}`     | Active **RC** cycle (renamed from beta). |

Non-versioned trees (`blog/`, `showcase/`, `contribute/`, `skills-market/`, `templates/`, `use-cases/`, `marketplace/`, `concepts/`, `essentials/`, `api-reference/`, `ai-tools/`, `guides/`, `snippets/`, `images/`, `logo/`) live only at root and are read by every version.

## Version path invariant

Before editing versioned docs, determine which release line the content belongs
to and verify the file path matches that line:

| Target line         | Edit path                                | Do not edit                          |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| Current stable / GA | `docs-site/{start,advanced,...}`         | `docs-site/beta/**` or `rc/**`       |
| Active beta         | `docs-site/beta/{start,advanced,...}`    | root `docs-site/{start,advanced}`    |
| Active RC           | `docs-site/rc/{start,advanced,...}`      | root `docs-site/{start,advanced}`    |
| Chinese stable      | `docs-site/zh/{start,advanced,...}`      | `docs-site/zh/beta/**` or `rc/**`    |
| Chinese beta        | `docs-site/zh/beta/{start,advanced,...}` | root `docs-site/zh/{start,advanced}` |
| Chinese RC          | `docs-site/zh/rc/{start,advanced,...}`   | root `docs-site/zh/{start,advanced}` |

Do not use the version dropdown label in a rendered page as proof of source
scope. Mintlify renders all versions from one repository and `docs.json`, so the
only reliable source-of-truth is the MDX path plus the matching `docs.json`
version block.

When beta-only content accidentally lands in root, release users see beta
behavior under the Release selector. Treat that as a release-docs incident, not
as a rendering issue.

### Pre-commit audit for versioned changes

Run a path-scope audit before committing workflow, phase, artifact, install, or
platform behavior changes:

```bash
cd docs-site
git diff --name-only --cached

# For beta-only behavior, changed files must be under beta/ or zh/beta/.
# For stable behavior, changed files must be root versioned paths or zh/ root
# versioned paths.
```

Then grep for version-specific markers in the opposite tree. Example for a beta
workflow change:

```bash
rg -n "task-creation consent|codex-mode|<trellis-workflow>|planning artifact|`design\\.md`|`implement\\.md`" \
  start advanced guides zh/start zh/advanced zh/guides -g "*.mdx"
```

The command should return no hits except unrelated filename mentions such as
`trellis-implement.md`.

## 4 lifecycle states

```
T0  release-only          ← steady state between cycles
        │   docs.json: versions = ["Release"]
        │   files:     root/{start, advanced, ...}
        │
        ▼   start a beta cycle
T1  release + beta
        │   docs.json: versions = ["Release", "Beta"]
        │   files:     root/...    +  beta/{start, advanced, ...}
        │
        ▼   beta → rc
T2  release + rc
        │   docs.json: versions = ["Release", "RC"]
        │   files:     root/...    +  rc/{start, advanced, ...}     (rename beta/ → rc/)
        │
        ▼   rc → release (GA promote)
T3  release-only           ← back to T0; root is the new GA
        │   docs.json: versions = ["Release"]
        │   files:     root/...    (rc/* content folded into root, rc/ deleted)
        ▼
```

---

## Scripts

Three POSIX shell scripts in `docs-site/scripts/`:

| Script               | Transition | What it does                                                                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ---------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs-beta-start.sh` | T0 → T1    | Copy versioned content (`start/`, `advanced/`, `index.mdx`) from root → `beta/`. Mirrors `zh/`.                                        |
| `docs-beta-to-rc.sh` | T1 → T2    | `git mv beta rc` (and `zh/beta` → `zh/rc`). Bulk text replace `@beta` → `@rc` inside `rc/*` content.                                   |
| `docs-promote.sh`    | T2 → T3    | Detect dev tree (`rc/` preferred over `beta/`), overwrite root versioned content with dev content, mirror in `zh/`, `git rm` dev tree. |

All three are **content-copy / rename only**. They never touch `docs.json` or the banner — those follow as manual edits because they're decision-driven.

### Manual followups

Each script ends with a checklist of `docs.json` edits and content scrubs the maintainer must apply before committing. Always:

| After                | Edit `docs.json`                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `docs-beta-start.sh` | Add `"Beta"` version block to `versions[]`. Add banner. Bump beta install commands to `@beta`. |
| `docs-beta-to-rc.sh` | Rename `"Beta"` label → `"RC"`. Update each page entry `beta/* → rc/*`. Update banner.         |
| `docs-promote.sh`    | Drop the `"Beta"` / `"RC"` version block from `versions[]`. Drop banner. Update navbar `href`. |

## When to use each

| Scenario                                                | Script                                | Trigger                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| First beta of a new minor / major (e.g. `0.6.0-beta.0`) | `docs-beta-start.sh`                  | Right before `pnpm release:beta` for the `.0` |
| Beta cycle stabilizing → first RC                       | `docs-beta-to-rc.sh`                  | Before `pnpm release:rc` for the `-rc.0`      |
| RC stable → cut GA                                      | `docs-promote.sh`                     | Before `pnpm release:promote`                 |
| Subsequent beta / rc patches (`-beta.1`, `-rc.1`, ...)  | (none — just write the changelog mdx) | Per-patch; no structural change needed        |

**Per-patch flow** (`-beta.1` → `-beta.2`, `-rc.1` → `-rc.2`, ...): just create `changelog/v<version>.mdx` (en + zh), add to top of pages list in `docs.json`, bump navbar href. No script invocation.

## One-time historical flip (0.5.0 GA)

Before 0.5.0, the layout was inverted: `root/` held the **dev** content (RC), and `release/` held the **previous GA** archive (0.4.0). At 0.5.0 GA we flipped to the convention above:

- Root content (was `0.5.0-rc.X`) became the new stable `0.5.0` GA in place
- `release/` (0.4.0 archive) was deleted (`git rm -r`); 0.4.x docs remain accessible via the `v0.4.0` git tag
- `docs.json` collapsed from 2 versions to 1 (`Release` only)
- The 3 scripts were introduced to keep the lifecycle reproducible going forward

After this flip, every future cycle uses the scripts; no further manual restructure should be needed.

---

## First real-cycle run: 0.6.0 GA (2026-06-15)

The 0.5.0 flip created the scripts; **0.6.0 GA was the first cycle that actually exercised the full T0→T1→T2→T3 chain end-to-end with `docs-promote.sh`**. Notes captured below to disambiguate the 0.5.0 precedent (which itself diverges from the standard flow because it was a one-time historical flip).

### `docs.json` transformation differs from 0.5.0

| Cycle | Pre-flip state | Right edit pattern |
|---|---|---|
| 0.5.0 (historical flip) | `RC` block had **root** paths, `Release` block had `release/*` paths (old GA archive) | Rename `RC` → `Release` label, **drop** the old `Release` block, `git rm -r release/` |
| 0.6.0 (standard flow) | `RC` block has `rc/*` paths, `Release` block has **root** paths (current GA) | **Drop** the `RC` block (its `rc/*` paths die when `docs-promote.sh` deletes the rc/ directory), keep `Release` as-is (its root paths now serve promoted v0.6 content), set `Release.default = true` |

Concrete edit list for the standard flow (post-`docs-promote.sh`, both languages):

1. `delete d['banner']`
2. Drop the `RC` version block from `versions[]` entirely
3. Set `Release.default = true` (the flag was on `RC`)
4. Insert `changelog/v<NEW_GA>` and `zh/changelog/v<NEW_GA>` at the top of each `Release` block's `Changelog` pages list
5. Update `navbar.links[label=Changelog].href` to `/changelog/v<NEW_GA>`

### First dual-package GA promote

0.6.0 was the first GA where both `@mindfoldhq/trellis` (CLI) and `@mindfoldhq/trellis-core` (SDK) ship in lockstep. `bump-versions.js promote` rewrites both `package.json` files and the CLI's `dependencies["@mindfoldhq/trellis-core"]` from `workspace:*` to the exact version at release time. `release-preflight verify-packed-cli` exists specifically to catch a divergence here — always run it before `pnpm release:promote`.

### Stale navbar Changelog `href` gotcha

The 0.6.0 cycle shipped 24 betas + 1 RC, and the navbar `Changelog` href in `docs.json` was never updated through any of them — it sat at `/changelog/v0.6.0-beta.22` at GA prep time. Per-patch beta/rc commits add the new mdx to the nav pages list, but they routinely forget the navbar href. Decision rule: **the GA promote PR is the last chance to fix the navbar href**, since GA is when readers actually start clicking the top-bar Changelog link.

### Pre-ship adversarial verify is load-bearing

The 0.6.0 GA prep flow ran a 10-agent pre-ship verify before `pnpm release:promote` and it caught 2 RED blockers that would have shipped:

1. `@mindfoldhq/trellis@beta` left in a bundled-skill markdown table after the lifecycle flip
2. Manifest's `**Bundled skills**` section listed 3 of the 4 actually-shipping bundled skills

Both blockers were prose-only (no code defect); both would have only embarrassed-not-broken users. Still, the adversarial verify earned its keep — recommend running an equivalent check on every future GA. The 10 angles (bundled skills + manifest + changelogs en/zh + docs.json + root content + preflight + tests + dogfood + npm-ready) generalize to any subsequent minor.

---

## Gotchas

### `docs.json` doesn't auto-update

Scripts only touch content trees. Forgetting the `docs.json` followup leads to:

- `T1 → T2`: pages still resolve at `beta/...` URLs but dropdown labels `RC` (404 on click)
- `T2 → T3`: stale `RC` dropdown remains while content is gone (404 on every page)

Always run `mintlify dev` locally after the script + manual edits to catch routing drift before push.

### Banner is sticky

The RC banner has been `"📦 Reading **RC** docs (0.5.0-rc.0)..."` literally across rc.0–rc.7 because nothing auto-bumps the version inside it. Either:

- Treat the banner as "RC docs in general — check `trellis --version` for your install" (current pattern), or
- Bump it as part of `docs-beta-to-rc.sh` followup (current scripts do not — they only print a reminder)

### MDX `<Note>` / `<Warning>` closing tags must NOT be indented

When a `<Note>` block contains a markdown list, prettier auto-indents the closing tag to align with the list:

```mdx
<Note>
- bullet
  </Note>   ← BREAKS Mintlify parser: "Expected closing tag </Note> after end of listItem"
</Note>     ← correct: closing tag at column 0
```

If you commit through `lint-staged` + prettier, expect re-indentation. Manually re-fix and commit, or add a `// prettier-ignore` if the project later supports it. Always run `pnpm dev` (mintlify) before pushing changelog mdx with these blocks.

### Stash workflow when RC and GA prep overlap

If you're staging GA content (`changelog/v0.5.0.mdx`, scripts/, `release/` deletions) while still needing to ship one more rc.X:

```bash
cd docs-site
git stash push -u -m "GA promote prep"  # park GA changes
# ... work on rc.X (changelog mdx + docs.json bump) ...
git commit && git push
git stash pop                            # restore GA prep; resolve docs.json conflict
```

The `docs.json` conflict at pop is expected — the rc.X commit added `v0.5.0-rc.X` at the top of pages list, while the stash had `v0.5.0` at the top. Keep both, with `v0.5.0` first (GA), then `v0.5.0-rc.X`, then older entries.
