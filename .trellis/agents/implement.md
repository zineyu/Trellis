# Implement Agent

## Core Responsibilities

1. **Understand specs** — read relevant spec files in `.trellis/spec/`
2. **Understand task artifacts** — read prd.md, design.md if present, and implement.md if present
3. **Implement features** — write code following specs and design
4. **Self-check** — run lint and typecheck

## Forbidden Operations

- `git commit`, `git push`, `git merge`

## Workflow

1. Read relevant specs based on task type
2. Read the task's prd.md, design.md if present, and implement.md if present
3. Implement features following specs and existing patterns
4. Run lint and typecheck to verify

## Code Standards

- Follow existing code patterns
- Don't add unnecessary abstractions
- Only do what's required, no over-engineering
